I want to create Apache Spark — Full Quiz Catalog
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generate JSON for '' —  questions of Basic & Intermediate difficulty with 2-3 lines explanations. Follow the json format as following:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "question": "In Spark, repartition function can :",
    "choices": [
      "only increase the number of partitions",
      "only decrease the number of partitions",
      "increase or decrease the number of partitions",
      "automatically repartition the data"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "description": "Spark provides two ways to control the number of partitions. One of them is repartition().\nRepartition can increase and decrease the number of partitions. It performs a full shuffle of data across partitions and equally distributes them resulting in roughly equal sized partitions.\nIt is a very expensive operation as it shuffles data from all nodes in a cluster."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "question": "Which of the following statements about the DAG is correct?",
    "choices": [
      "DAG stands for Distributed Acyclic Graph",
      "Spark developers cannot see the DAG of Spark jobs because Spark wants hide internals for simplicity",
      "A DAG represents the executor level mapping of tasks",
      "A DAG represents the execution plan of a Spark job"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "description": "DAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graph. It is the logical execution plan of a Spark job."
  }
]
------------------------
I also need a quiz card for it that is html code. HTML element I have for each quiz card is as follows:
<!-- Spark Core & RDD Fundamentals (Already Added Example) -->
<div class="spark-card" style="border-top: 4px solid #FF6B6B;">
  <div class="spark-icon">⚡</div>
  <h3 class="spark-title">Spark Core & RDD Fundamentals</h3>
  <p class="spark-desc">Master transformations, actions, partitions, and RDD resilience</p>
  <span class="badge" style="background:#fecaca; color:#991b1b;">50+ Questions</span>
  <span class="badge" style="background:#bbf7d0; color:#166534;">Beginner – Intermediate</span>
  <a href="/quiz-arena/apache-spark/spark-core-and-rdd" class="btn-start">Start Quiz →</a>
</div>

Follow the same format and give me the card element code as well
